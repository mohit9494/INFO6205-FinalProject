# INFO6205-FinalProject

This is the Team 14 final project implementing MSD radix sort for a natural language which uses Unicode characters.

## Overview

In this project out primary goal is to sort Chinese strings in the English order of Pinyin using MSD radix sort. To achieve this, we followed following approach 
- Convert Chinese strings to Pinyin
- convert the Pinyin to long arrays
- Sorting the array by comparing the corresponding long values

We have implemented following sorting algorithms

1. MSD RadixSort
2. LSD Radixsort
3. 3-way Quicksort
4. Dual Pivot Quicksort
5. TimSort
6. HuskySort
7. InsertionSort (only used for performance tuning to sort subarray after cutoff is reached)
